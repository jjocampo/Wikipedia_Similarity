# Wikipedia_Similarity
Exploring visualizing Wikipedia page content similarity based on site search. 

I pivoted part way through this, as I realized there might be a better way to visualize/ think about similarity. The MDS algorithm highlighted some interesting things, but also displayed some unrelated things. MDS is a good technique, but getting the math to work out would take longer than my other idea for this. As such, this is some good code but it's not polished or a completed project.
